We are impressed by your study "Immunological characteristics govern the transition of COVID-19 to endemicity" [1], which highlights the necessity of behavioral containment in the years ahead during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. However, we noticed two technical issues related to the accuracy of the prediction, which is worthy of discussion considering the potential impact of this piece of work on public health policy worldwide. The primary infectious period in your modelling is set as 9 days. Nevertheless, the mean duration of viral shedding does not necessarily equal the mean infectious period in a compartmental model to simulate the pandemic. In the model setting (the classic SIR model), the mean infectious period should equal the mean generation time (see [2]), there are at least three studies which showed that the mean generation time is 5 days. Therefore, the time interval of 9 days is obviously longer than the widely reported 5 days [3]. The Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR) for data analysis comes from the work by Verity et al., [4] which was based on data mainly from mainland China in February 2020, when the COVID-19 not yet prevailed around the globe. Nevertheless, on April 17, 2020, China revised the reported COVID-19 deaths from 3352 to 4642. Verity et al. was not able to correspondingly update the data considering the publication date. Even if Verity et al. could have updated their results based on the revised deaths, the population context was mostly limited in mainland China in that time (February 2020) without much incorporation of the global data. It should be suggested to apply IFRs reported by more comprehensive research on global population after the COVID-19 became a pandemic.  It has been almost a year since the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Given the sheer number of cases and deaths worldwide, it is not reasonable anymore to carry out analysis based on the estimated IFR in February 2020.  There should be more reliable and updated IFR available. For instance, we used the covid-19 cases and deaths in Hong Kong (HK), China, which spans from February 2020 up to now [5]. The number of deaths from COVID-19 in HK collected by the HK surveillance data is carefully conducted and reliable. There were four waves of community outbreaks in HK since 2020 and the age structure of COVID-19 cases is representative of the general population. There has been extensive testing conducted in HK, including one universal community testing of 1.78 million out of 7.5 million population carried out in early September 2020. The local outbreaks in HK were gradually under control without much overwhelming the healthcare system and the testing capacity. The COVID-19 cases identified by the PCR-tests, which are composed of a reasonable proportion of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, should picked up most of the infections in the City.  Though a considerable proportion of cases are imported, if we focus on the number of local cases and deaths, the Case Fatality Ratio (approximately equals IFR in Hong Kong) should be a good standard for an international city with functioning medical system. The comparison of the age specific IFR estimated by Verity et al. and the surveillance data in HK was shown in Table 1. Here we assume that the CFR approximately equals the IFR considering the extensive community testing of COVID-19 in HK. Although the case numbers are typically underreported, the case ascertainment rate in HK should be closer to 1 compared with 0.5 estimated by Verity et al. [4]. Supposing an existing 50% ascertainment rate, it is still not sufficient to explain the huge gap between the two IFR age profiles. Therefore, it is highly suggested to apply an IFR estimated by more updated and accurate data in the published modelling work titled "Immunological characteristics govern the transition of COVID-19 to endemicity".

[5] https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/local_situation_covid19_en.pdf As of February 12, 2021, more than 100 people were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 variants in Japan. In February 2021, a large-scale cluster (infected population) of SARS-CoV-2 variants-infected persons occurred in Saitama Prefecture in Japan. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants is gradually spreading in Japan. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that "the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants is 1.4 to 1.7 times higher than that of conventional SARS-CoV-2" (1). Infectious disease experts in Japan are becoming more cautious about the spread of infection by SARS-CoV-2 variants. As of February 12, 2021, in Japan, 93 people were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 variant derived from the United Kingdom (UK), 11 people were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 variant derived from South Africa, and 4 people are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 variant derived of Brazil (2). As of February 8, 2021, WHO reports that cases of SARS-CoV-2 variants derived from the UK have been identified in 86 countries around the world. In 2020 of October, in the Manaus city in Brazil, 76% of residents of Manaus city, had acquired the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. However, since the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 variant derived from Brazil in mid-December 2020, the number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 variant derived from Brazil has increased significantly. In other words, the immunological antiviral effect of the neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 has not been observed for the SARS-CoV-2 variant derived from Brazil. Recent studies have revealed the following matters (3).
The N501Y mutation does not affect the three-dimensional structure of conventional SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. From this research result, it was clarified that the binding property of the spike glycoprotein N501Y mutant to human ACE2 was stronger than that of the conventional SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. From this study, it was revealed that the affinity between the spike glycoprotein N501Y mutant and 24 of the 27 neutralizing antibodies examined was clearly weak compared to the conventional SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. With the advent of the variants of the SARS-CoV-2, there is a possibility that the vaccine effect is inhibited. Therefore, the development of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is even more important. Ethics statement

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.27.401893v1 Incorporating information from the four endemic human coronaviruses on a mathematical model, J. Lavine et al. (Jan 12th 2021) predict that over the next few years a growing proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults will be re-infections and less severe. Once the endemic phase will be reached, primary exposures will be in childhood. Then, 'COVID-19 may be no more virulent than the common cold'(1).  The authors assume that 'infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly, but disease-reducing immunity is long-lived'(1). Accordingly, a successful vaccine rollout would accelerate the shift from pandemic to endemic. In Spain, vaccination begun on Dec 27th with roughly 500,000 people vaccinated within the first two weeks. Unexpectedly, new diagnoses of COVID-19 were reported after first-dose vaccination(2). We hypothesize that if any of the current licensed vaccines are given to persons during the incubation period -as it seems to be the case during the ongoing third wave surge-, selection of vaccine-escape mutants will inevitably occur, as already shown in experimental models(3). The mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2 is lower than for other RNA viruses, such as HIV or hepatitis C virus, given the presence of a nuclease that repairs mistakes. Even so, evolution of viral genomes follows the rule of quasispecies. A constellation of variants evolves around a consensus sequence over time and across tissues and individuals. Accordingly, mutations that would result in antiviral resistance or escape to neutralizing antibodies pre-exist and would expand under drug or vaccine pressure, respectively (4). Interventions that would reduce the risk for selection of vaccine-escape variants include: rapid and wider vaccination; refraining from vaccination those presumably having acute infection, perhaps using rapid antigen testing; developing new vaccines with much broader antigenicity; and administration throughout inhalation for inducing mucosal immunity including IgA antibodies. The latest would halt viral replication in the respiratory airway and ultimately transmissions. Vicente Soriano

None to report for all authors In a fascinating research report, the expert authors evaluate data on endemic human coronaviruses, and show that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly, but disease-reducing immunity does not. It begs the question as to what is the best strategy for transitioning from a pandemic to a locally-contained endemic, possibly based on a high threshold of the population having been reached for viral infections, or a successful vaccination program, or both, to achieve herd immunity? This leads to the following issues: (1) How does viral evolution develop? (2) Do mutated strains become more resistant to currently approved vaccines? (3) Can vaccines be adapted to deal with the more highly transmissible and infectious strains or variants that have been discovered in the UK and South Africa?? (4) Will the mutated strains lead to variations in the percentage of the population that is asymptomatic? (5) Furthermore, will the mutated strains lead to variations in the percentage of the population that might suffer from long haul COVID-19 effects? (6) How large are the regions for purposes of defining endemicity, such as city, state, province, prefecture, country, sub-continent, continent, or hemisphere? (7) How does the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 differ from SARS (or SARS-CoV-1) and MERS? (8) Can specific immunity types be predicted in the short run and long run? (9) Can the duration of a pandemic such as COVID-19 be predicted? (10) Can the duration of the effectiveness of alternative approved vaccines be predicted? (11) At what point will the age distribution of infected cases differ from that of the population? (12) What happens if older individuals have not acquired immunity through having been infected, vaccinated, or both, at an early age? (13) How many times will an individual need to be infected to acquire immunity from the virus? (14) How many times will an individual need to be vaccinated to acquire immunity from the virus? (15) What are the interactive effects of infection and subsequent vaccination, or the reverse? (16) What is the likely duration of the transition from a pandemic to an endemic status, and how long with endemicity last? (17) What are the effects of existing comorbidities on the transition to, and duration of, endemicity? (18) What are the effects of the age structure on the transition to, and duration of, endemicity? (19) Are the properties of the approved vaccines likely to perform differently in the pandemic and endemic states? (20) Are the properties of the mutated strains likely to be different in the pandemic and endemic states?   Total number of
